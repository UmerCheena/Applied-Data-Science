# Applied-Data-Science
Assignment-2 Clustering and Fitting

# Introduction:

This report includes a data set with details of coursera courses and gives us analysis to uncover different results, such as course_organization, course_certificate_type, course_time, course_rating, and course_difficulty. We have done course segmentation to understand course’s behavior. We will also explore clustering techniques and make the fitting process in data.

# Conclusion:

The investigation of the Coursera dataset gives experiences into course characteristics such as appraisals, enrollments, trouble levels, and certification sorts. Apprentice courses frequently draw in more learners, whereas progressed courses are more common in proficient certificates and specializations. Most courses are outlined for completion inside 1-3 months, adjusting openness and profundity. Division and clustering uncover designs in learner inclinations and engagement, advertising significant bits of knowledge for optimizing course plan and promoting techniques. This investigation highlights key patterns forming online learning.
