Assignment-2 Clustering and Fitting

Introduction:

This report includes a data set with details of coursera courses and gives us analysis to uncover different results, such as course_organization, course_certificate_type, course_time, course_rating, and course_difficulty. We have done course segmentation to understand course’s behavior. We will also explore clustering techniques and make the fitting process in data.

Conclusion:

The analysis of the Coursera dataset provides insights into course characteristics such as ratings, enrollments, difficulty levels, and certification types. Beginner courses often attract more learners, while advanced courses are more common in professional certificates and specializations. Most courses are designed for completion within 1-3 months, balancing accessibility and depth. Segmentation and clustering reveal patterns in learner preferences and engagement, offering actionable insights for optimizing course design and marketing strategies. This analysis highlights key trends shaping online learning.
